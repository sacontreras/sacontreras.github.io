<p>By trade, I previously called myself a "Software Engineer".  I am self-taught and have more than 20 years of experience in the industry.  My focus has been Systems/Back-end development with my primary language being Java.  I have built RESTful Web Services hosted in the cloud.  I also have experience in Mobile Development on Android, with friend-end applications in the Telephony sphere.  Having a background in Mathematics, my interest is now guiding me in the direction of Data Science.</p>
