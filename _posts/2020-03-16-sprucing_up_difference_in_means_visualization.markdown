In this post, I will demonstrate how to convert a confidence interval for the difference of means of two independent samples into null-hypothesis rejection and non-rejection regions using Matplotlib, Scipy, and Jupyter Notebook.

This visualization supports both one and two-tailed two-sample T-Tests.

To support this, I will include an accompanying T-Distribution visualization that support the same, as well supporting code to wrap the accompanying T-Test execution.
