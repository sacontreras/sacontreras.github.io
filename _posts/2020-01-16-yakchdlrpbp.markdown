YAKCHDLRPBP stands for "Yet Another King County Housing Data Linear Regression Project Blog Post".

Yep.  That's right.  I just coined a new acronym.

But seriously, though, using the King County housing data set to build a Linear Regression project is so common these days that one can almost say, "if you've seen one then you'vre seen them all".

Well, my hope is that my project stands out so that one can take away something new, so that the above euphamism doesn't apply.

You be the judge.

## Project Goals
Of course A goal in my project was to build a linear regression that is statistically "reliable".

But, for me, an even more important goal was to put that model to use to solve a hypothetical "real world" problem one might encounter when selling a home in King County.

To that end, those goals were:
<ol>
<li>to <b><i>provide an answer to the question, "which features can be FEASIBLY addressed by a seller to increase the sale price of his/her home?"</i></b></li>
<li>to <b><i>provide a CONCRETE strategy using an optimized linear regression model to accomplish this</i></b>.</li>
</ol>
